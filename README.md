Using usepackage based init file.

Installing emacs on mac is mess.  There are so many ports.  
The latest one I have manage to install successfully is this one:
https://github.com/jimeh/emacs-builds
- `brew tap jimeh/emacs-builds`
- `brew install --cask emacs-app`

steps:

cd ~
`git clone https://github.com/ealemank/emacs-config.git .emacs.d`
